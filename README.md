# Crypto Kitchen

## Why Should You Care?
Coz we started this project for fun and got so much positive feedback and fun that we cannot stop üôÉ

## What We Do
We **educate people of all levels** about the blockchain space while casually sharing food and drinks during or after the event. Keep it cozy üçµ

## Track Record
So far we did a no-knowledge-required hands-on workshops to teach how to use Web3 tools such as Metamask, Maker, etc. In September 2020 we did our first **DeFi Webinar** for professionals of the blockchain space, running over **2h30m**, to help those who are too busy to keep up with the latest trends.

## Food and Crypto?
Yes ma'am, and in your kitchen! Do not underestimate the power of the kitchen, meals unites us all ü•ëüçéü•¨üç¶üç©

## History
This project was started for fun in Barcelona in **Feb 2020** at **Akasha Hub** by Igor Line, Ludo Bret and Adrien Berthou. The same crew who leads the **Barcelona Blockchain Love meetup group**. Note that it was started out of frustration of having so many blockchain event attendants who had never used basic tools such as Metamask.
